 $ python3 tictactoe.py
 ```
- Follow the instructions to start the game
- DO NOT close the Turtle window. The program will clear the screen itself after each game

## How to play the game
- The box which is to be marked is to be specified by a two character input when prompted
- t stands for the top row, m stands for the middle row, and b stands for the bottom one
- Similarly, l stands for the left column, c stands for the centre column, and r stands for the right one
- So for example, mc would mark the central box and tr would mark the top right one
- Enjoy!
